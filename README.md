## Name
Hiroki Sato (Under Supervision of Dr. Daniel S Myers at Rollins College)

## Description
As a music and computer science major, while contemplating how science and art could intersect, I have been inspired by what artificial intelligence is capable of and how extensively it can be used to better our society. 
The project is a recommendation system which provide a list of twenty movies as a personalized and diverse recommendation which user might like based on movies given from a user. The system model a recommendation system which uses a random walk algorithm, used by a Pixie, recommendation engine for Pinterest.

sklearn to process string information and draw similarity.  
nltk: Natural Langualge Tool Kit to pre-process string before applying functions from sklearn.  
Pandas.
